# MovieReviewWebApp

1. We can create a movie database. This would be similar to rotten tomatoes, in where we fill the page with existing movies and allow users to rate/review them. Users would have the capabilities of adding and displaying movies as their favorites, reviewing, and rating movies. This would be displayed to other users, and allow them to connect to each other as well.

2. Movie enthusiasts would use it, along with friends who are trying to send movie recommendations in mass.

3. Each movie will need data such as the name, director, year released, and genre. We can obtain this by webscraping the iMDB.

4. It will need a UI to allow users to rate and display movies. It will also need a database in order to hold all these movies, as well as a backend API to keep up to date with movies that are newly released.
